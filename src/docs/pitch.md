# üî• Reflex ‚Äì Rethinking UI for a Declarative Future

---

## üéØ The Problem

- React apps often become tangled with `useState`, `useEffect`, and imperative glue code.
- External APIs like `setTimeout`, `WebSocket`, or event listeners add more boilerplate and scattered logic.
- Code becomes hard to reason about, debug, or scale ‚Äî especially in teams.
- AI assistants struggle to understand imperative and side-effect-heavy structures.

---

## üí° The Reflex Solution

> **‚ÄúDescribe what should happen, not how.‚Äù**

- Declarative building blocks for UI logic, events, effects, and APIs.
- Replace imperative code with readable, reusable components.
- Eliminate cleanup management, hook dependencies, and lifecycle caveats.
- UI logic becomes visual, composable, and self-contained.

## üß± Core Building Blocks

| Component        | Purpose                                  |
|------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| `<Signal />`      | Reactive values without `useState`        |
| `<When />`, `<Cond />` | Declarative conditionals for rendering logic |
| `<Timer />`, `<OnResize />`, `<WebSocket />` | Time, browser events, and APIs as components |
| `<Resource />`    | Handles async data with loading/error states |
| `<StateGroup />`  | Group multiple states into orchestrated flows |
| `<AnimatePresence />`, `<TransitionZone />` | Motion and transitions, declaratively |

## ü§ñ Made for AI-First Development

- Declarative syntax improves static analysis and reasoning.
- Code is easier for LLMs to understand and assist with.
- No hidden closures, unpredictable state, or buried logic.
- AI tooling becomes more useful when logic is visible in the UI tree.

---

## üß† Philosophy

> UIs should be **declared**, not **programmed**.

- HTML is successful because it's declarative.
- Reflex applies this principle to interaction logic, side effects, and APIs.
- Build UIs the way you describe them: structurally, cleanly, semantically.

---

## üöÄ Why It Matters

- Clean, maintainable UI logic.
- Onboard new developers faster.
- Safer and more consistent codebases.
- AI collaboration becomes practical and powerful.
- Building interfaces becomes fun again.

## üë• Join the Movement

Reflex is still in active development, and we‚Äôre building toward a fully declarative future for React.

- üëæ Contributors welcome
- üß™ Open to experiments and edge use cases
- üó∫Ô∏è Roadmap includes animations, effects, forms, and more
